The aim of this project is to display a color flow map image using cross-correlation based on ultrasound signals. Before
estimating velocity, two previous steps are required: the matched filtration of the data and the stationary echo removal. After that, the velocity
estimation can be carried out. Moreover, each of the blocks in the system are validated by using simulated ultrasound RF data from flowing blood at a constant
velocity. Lastly, a CFM image is generated using the in-vivo color flow data from the carotid artery. The model of the system and the simulation of the data
was developed in Matlab.
